# Sat Nam

A Jekyll-powered blog adapted from the [Shiori theme](https://github.com/ellekasai/shiori). 

### Special Thanks

[@ellekasai](https://github.com/ellekasai/) - for creating the open source Shiori theme. This is my first attempt at using Jekyll (or making any sort of non static site whatsoever). Shiori was easy to understand and edit - even for a beginner, and helped me understand Jekyll at a fundamental level without any prior experience.
